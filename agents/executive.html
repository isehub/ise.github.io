        <p>BIO: The product of the AGNUS DEI project. Found at every corner of the ISE's main campus and then some. Helpful, polite, friendly, and cheerful. Sentient; exhibits an acute understanding of her artificiality, and a lack of knowledge of her conception. Tucks what she refuses to acknowledge as "emotion" away in order to complete work more efficiently. Work is what she was built for, after all. </p>
