          <p>BIO: A temporal anomaly under strict surveillence. Fortuna's protege. A wholly irresponsible young man. Slave to temptation; bit the apple too early and without thinking, literally and figuratively. Horribly, horribly guilty. Hero complex. Thinks before he acts to make it look like he acts before he thinks. Sensitive to beaches. Too brave for his own good. Qualified for 5*, but security clearance is kept low due to past affiliations. Promiscuous.</p>

        <p>BIO: Well-known and trustworthy figure across several different universes. Regarded as a martyr on Genesis-III. Charismatic, pretty, and photogenic. Excellent at small talk and at squeezing information out of complete strangers and sensitive targets. Witty and silver-tongued, and very down-to-earth due to her humble upbringing. Selfless, but a bit stingy when it comes to certain subjects. Promiscuous.</p>
